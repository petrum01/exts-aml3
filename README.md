This is my course project for the Applied Machine Learning 2 course from the EPFL Extension School

The goal of this project is to build an image classifier on a subset of the CIFAR-10 data set with four categories: trucks, cars, airplanes, and ships.

The goal of this project is to use this set of high-level features to test the different classification methods from the course (decision trees, SVMs and so on) and compare the results to your own implementation of a ConvNet trained on the raw 32 by 32 RGB images.
